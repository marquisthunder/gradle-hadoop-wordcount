# Intrdocution

This is a very very simple mapreduce application. You can run this application in command with following command.

    ./gradlew run    
    
This command will download all the jars to your local machine. No hadoop installation package is required, no setting is required, just issue the command and does work!!

The output would print this information

	The output goes to: out/20140520170354
	
Just use

	cat out/20140520170354/part-r-00000
	
To see the result.

# Azure HDInsigh Support 

To make this example more-Hadoop-like, and make it run more smoothly under HDInsight, I add a new task 'hadoop', and define an argument named 'args' to pass all the required parameters. ( Thank @MonsterSupreme )
